## Project 1

I first got the project working without command line arguments. I focused on just learning
the python socket stuff. Once I figured out how to connect to a server, I figured out how to 
give back the appropriate response by counting the occurences correctly. Once that was done, I learned about the python argparse library and finished everything up.

I did face one challenge where I had a bug because I had a space and then a '\n' character. The space was messing up the message to send to the server. And it took me days to realize that I needed to get rid of that space :(. 

I used if statements to check to see if the server disconected from the socket at any moment. And I used a ton of print statements in my code.
