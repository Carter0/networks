In this assignment, the hardest part was getting started and figuring out what was generally going on. Once that was done, we just followed the tests one at a time.

The level two tests were difficult for us because we were accidentally calling handle packet twice and therefore duplicating all the packets were giving to our program. Once we figured that out, getting tests 2 and 3 to pass was not too bad.

Writing revoke also took a little while because we were not sure how to broadcast the messages. Also, we needed to get the right information from our routing table, which took a little time. 

Sending no route also proved a little challenging for us, but we did it. 

We mostly tested our code using the provided tests given to us.
