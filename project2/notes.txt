Got the router working with sim. 

Probably should get vagrant set up when they fix it. But for now testing needs 
to happen on the khory linux server in the dir with the router code.

Ex. ./bgp-sim/sim bgp-sim/tests/1-1-simple-send.conf 


You get update messages and data messages for the 1 tests.

For update, just update the update list.

For data, for now, just figure out which neighbor in the update list to send to
Do this by just matching the ip for now. Though I imagine we will have to 
do a bitwise and at some point and then do a highest prefix match, though im not
sure how that completely works. 

Send out by a socket send to the network in the update list.


Also, the AS number will be used to prevent loops. Basically, 
when our router gets a message and it sees its own as number, then it knows that 
there is a loop since the message has been here before.

Sunday, Feb 2nd

The routing table will have a few entries as of right now
1. In the example, the src will be the 12.0.0.0. The next hop will be the 172.65.0.2 number, and 
the netmask will be the netmask 
2. The routing table will for now be a dictionary of lists.
3. In order to do the longest prefix matching, we will sort the list by the longest prefix and 
return the first match.
